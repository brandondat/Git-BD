# Project Green
(In Progress)

**Please install git and fork the Shared Drive directory.

The goal of this project is to determine the difference in interest payments between two different interest calculations.  The first uses the actual way interest was calculated using 

The project folder is broken down into two parts:
* Code for loan downloader [TBD]:
    * The loan downloader code is an exported module and workbook.
* Code for data analysis [R Code]
    * The data analysis compiles the results from the loan downloader.
      * 001_base: A generic code that loads in commonly used packages, custom function, calendars, etc.
      * 002__vac: A code that uses manually downloaded Bloomberg VAC screens to 

## Basic Theory

#### Method 1 (Example)
| Loan       | Original Rate | Cool  |
| ---------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Loan 1     | 5.00%         | $1600 |
| Loan 2     | centered      |   $12 |
| Loan 3     | are neat      |    $1 |
